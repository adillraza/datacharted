1. Data Strategy & Consulting
Aligning Your Data With Your Business Goals
In today‚Äôs digital world, businesses generate more data than ever before. But without the right strategy, that data often remains siloed, messy, or underutilized. At Datacharted, we help organizations transform raw information into actionable insights through a structured and business-driven data strategy.

Why Data Strategy Matters
A clear data strategy ensures that your business doesn‚Äôt just collect information ‚Äî it uses it effectively. Too often, companies invest in tools without aligning them to key performance indicators (KPIs) or business outcomes. The result is a patchwork of disconnected systems and reports that fail to answer the most important questions.
Our consulting process is designed to:
Break down data silos by unifying platforms and tools.
Define KPIs that reflect your true business goals.
Build scalable frameworks that grow as your business grows.
Lay the foundation for advanced analytics, forecasting, and decision-making.

2. Data Integration & Automation
Unifying Your Data Into a Single Source of Truth
Most businesses today run on dozens of platforms ‚Äî CRMs, marketing tools, finance software, call tracking, e-commerce systems, and more. While each system plays an important role, they rarely ‚Äútalk‚Äù to each other. The result? Scattered insights, duplicated effort, and missed opportunities.
At Datacharted, we specialize in data integration and automation ‚Äî bringing all your business data together in one place and ensuring it flows seamlessly.

Why Data Integration Matters
Without integration, you‚Äôre stuck manually exporting CSVs, reconciling spreadsheets, and wasting hours just to get a basic report. Integration ensures:
Accuracy ‚Äì no manual errors from copy-pasting.
Speed ‚Äì reports update automatically in near real-time.
Trust ‚Äì one version of the truth for every team.
Scalability ‚Äì as your tools grow, your data ecosystem adapts.
Automation adds another layer, ensuring your reports and dashboards update themselves, freeing your team to focus on decisions, not data wrangling.

What We Offer
When you engage us for Data Integration & Automation, here‚Äôs what you can expect:
Source Connectivity
We connect all your platforms ‚Äî Google Ads, Facebook Ads, GA4, CRMs, e-commerce systems, call tracking tools, and more ‚Äî into a central data warehouse like Google BigQuery.
Commercial Tools & Open-Source Solutions
We work with enterprise-grade connectors like Fivetran and Funnel.io, as well as open-source tools like Airbyte. This gives you flexibility depending on your budget and needs.

Automated Workflows
We set up automated pipelines so data flows continuously without manual intervention. Whether daily, hourly, or near real-time, your dashboards always stay fresh.
Data Validation & Monitoring
Automation doesn‚Äôt just move data ‚Äî it safeguards it. We build checks to detect anomalies, missing values, or failed syncs, so you can trust the data you see.

Who Benefits From Integration & Automation?
Agencies tired of spending hours preparing client reports.
Retailers needing to unify sales, shipping, and inventory data.
Subscription businesses consolidating churn, revenue, and customer lifecycle metrics.

Experience across hundreds of integrations.
Proven track record with long-term automation projects.
Ability to handle both standard and highly custom use cases.

Get Started
Data integration and automation is the backbone of any modern data strategy. Without it, reporting remains slow, manual, and error-prone. With it, you unlock speed, accuracy, and confidence in every business decision.

3. Data Modeling & Transformation
Turning Raw Data Into Reliable, Actionable Insights
Raw data is rarely ready to use. It comes in different formats, contains inconsistencies, and often lacks the structure needed for analysis. Without a strong data model, dashboards show misleading results, and decision-making suffers.
At Datacharted, we specialize in data modeling and transformation ‚Äî cleaning, enriching, and structuring your data so it becomes a trustworthy foundation for reporting, analytics, and forecasting.

Why Data Modeling Matters
Think of your data model as the blueprint of your business information. A weak or poorly designed model means:
Numbers don‚Äôt reconcile across teams.
Dashboards become slow or inconsistent.
Business questions take days to answer instead of seconds.
With a robust data model, however, you can:
Trust that KPIs are accurate and consistent.
Answer complex questions with ease.
Scale reporting as your data and business grow.

What We Offer
Data Cleansing & Standardization
We remove duplicates, correct inconsistencies, and standardize formats to ensure every field (like dates, currencies, or IDs) aligns across sources.
Business Logic & KPI Definitions
We codify your business rules (e.g., how to define ‚Äúactive user,‚Äù ‚Äúchurned customer,‚Äù or ‚Äúverified lead‚Äù) into the data model, ensuring every report tells the same story.
Data Transformation Pipelines
Using tools like BigQuery SQL, Dataform, or dbt, we create transformation workflows that reshape raw data into analysis-ready tables.
Scalable Architecture
We design models that grow with your data volume and business complexity ‚Äî no bottlenecks, no rework every quarter.
Enrichment & Joins
We connect multiple data sources (marketing, sales, finance, operations) into a single, unified model. This creates cross-functional insights that siloed systems can‚Äôt provide.

Who Benefits From Data Modeling & Transformation?
Agencies who need consistent metrics across dozens of clients.
E-commerce companies connecting sales, inventory, and logistics.
Subscription businesses tracking customer lifecycles, upgrades, and churn.
Executives seeking confidence in KPIs before making strategic decisions.

Why Choose Datacharted?
We don‚Äôt just build tables ‚Äî we design data foundations. With 18+ years of experience, we know how to balance technical efficiency with business usability.
Expertise in Google BigQuery, Dataform, dbt, Redshift, and Snowflake.
Ability to codify business-specific logic into repeatable workflows.
Proven record of delivering models that scale with client growth.

Get Started
If your dashboards feel unreliable or inconsistent, the problem likely lies in your data model. Let us help you build a strong foundation so that every report, dashboard, and decision rests on accurate, consistent, and trusted data.

4. Dashboard Design & Visualization
Transforming Data Into Clear, Interactive Dashboards
Raw numbers and endless spreadsheets can overwhelm even the best decision-makers. What leaders need are dashboards that tell a story ‚Äî visuals that cut through the noise, highlight key trends, and guide action.
At Datacharted, we specialize in dashboard design and data visualization. We turn complex datasets into intuitive dashboards that allow teams to see, explore, and act on insights at a glance.

Why Dashboards Matter
Data without visualization is like a map without directions. Dashboards give clarity by:
Highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs) in real-time.
Revealing trends and anomalies quickly.
Enabling decision-makers to focus on what matters most.
Making data accessible to everyone, not just analysts.
The right dashboard empowers your business to make faster, smarter, and more confident decisions.

What We Offer
Executive Scorecards
High-level dashboards designed for leadership teams, showing essential KPIs like revenue, customer growth, marketing ROI, and profitability ‚Äî all in one place.

Visualization Best Practices
We apply principles of visual storytelling ‚Äî using the right charts, layouts, and color coding to make insights clear and intuitive.
Mobile & Cross-Device Accessibility
Dashboards are designed to work across devices so your team can access insights wherever they are.

Who Benefits From Dashboard Design & Visualization?
Executives who need quick clarity on business health.
Agencies managing multiple client campaigns and KPIs.
Retailers tracking sales, shipping, and inventory metrics.
Subscription businesses monitoring churn, retention, and revenue growth.

Why Choose Datacharted?
We don‚Äôt just build pretty dashboards ‚Äî we design decision-making tools. With years of experience across industries, we understand which KPIs matter most and how to present them effectively.

Experience creating hundreds of dashboards across marketing, sales, operations, and finance.
Proven ability to balance clean design with technical accuracy.

5. Advanced Analytics & Forecasting
Looking Beyond the Present to Predict What‚Äôs Next
Understanding what has happened in your business is important. But true growth comes from anticipating what will happen next. Advanced analytics and forecasting allow businesses to move from reactive decision-making to proactive planning ‚Äî predicting demand, identifying risks, and uncovering hidden opportunities.
At Datacharted, we help businesses leverage advanced analytics techniques and predictive modeling to not only explain the past but also forecast the future.

Why Advanced Analytics Matters
Most dashboards show what happened yesterday. Advanced analytics helps you answer questions like:
Which campaigns will generate the most leads next quarter?
Which customers are most likely to churn?
How should inventory be allocated to meet future demand?
What‚Äôs the expected return if marketing spend increases by 20%?
By applying predictive modeling, machine learning, and statistical analysis, we empower businesses to make smarter, forward-looking decisions.

What We Offer
Predictive Modeling
Using historical data, we build models that forecast outcomes such as sales growth, customer churn, or lead conversion probability.
Forecasting & Trend Analysis
We apply time-series forecasting and statistical models to project future performance ‚Äî from revenue and demand to marketing ROI.
Segmentation & Behavioral Analytics
We uncover hidden customer patterns, segment audiences, and identify high-value cohorts for targeted marketing and retention strategies.
Performance Optimization
By analyzing past results, we determine which levers drive the biggest impact, helping you allocate budgets and resources more effectively.
Scenario Planning
We build "what-if" models that let you simulate different business scenarios and assess the potential outcomes before making big decisions.

Who Benefits From Advanced Analytics & Forecasting?
Marketing teams optimizing ad spend and predicting lead quality.
E-commerce businesses managing seasonal demand and inventory planning.
Agencies demonstrating ROI and proactive strategy to clients.
Executives making investment, expansion, or resourcing decisions.

Why Choose Datacharted?
We combine business intelligence expertise with machine learning techniques to deliver insights that are both technically robust and business-ready.
Skilled in BigQuery ML, Python, R, and machine learning frameworks.
Experience building predictive models across industries (marketing, retail, subscription services).
Ability to translate complex analytics into clear, actionable recommendations.

Get Started
If your current reporting only tells you what happened yesterday, you‚Äôre already behind. With advanced analytics and forecasting, you can anticipate tomorrow and plan with confidence.
üì© Schedule a strategy session today to discover how predictive insights can transform your business.

6. Custom API Connectors
Connecting Every Data Source ‚Äî Even When Tools Don‚Äôt Exist
Not all platforms provide ready-made connectors. Many CRMs, call tracking systems, or niche SaaS tools don‚Äôt integrate with your existing data stack. Without integration, valuable information gets stuck in silos ‚Äî impossible to combine with the rest of your reporting.
At Datacharted, we solve this problem by building custom API connectors. If a platform has a REST API, we can connect it, extract its data, and feed it into your data warehouse for seamless reporting and analysis.

Why Custom Connectors Matter
Standard connectors (Fivetran, Airbyte, Funnel.io) cover many popular tools ‚Äî but they can‚Äôt keep up with every niche platform or fast-changing API. If your business relies on one of these tools, you risk losing visibility into critical data.
Custom connectors ensure:
Complete visibility ‚Äì every platform contributes to your reporting.
Flexibility ‚Äì connectors adapt to your specific needs and business logic.
Scalability ‚Äì once built, connectors run automatically, updating your data warehouse without manual exports.

What We Offer
Connector Development for Any REST API
If your tool provides an API, we can build a connector ‚Äî handling authentication, pagination, error handling, and data extraction.
Popular Platforms We Support
We‚Äôve built connectors for CRMs like Go High Level, call tracking systems like CallRail, and many other niche platforms.
BigQuery Integration
Our connectors don‚Äôt just pull data ‚Äî they load it into structured tables in Google BigQuery, ready for transformation and visualization.
Monitoring & Maintenance
APIs change. We provide ongoing monitoring and quick fixes when endpoints are updated, so your data pipelines never break.
Custom Business Logic
Beyond extraction, we can enrich and reshape API data (for example, mapping campaign IDs, normalizing timestamps, or calculating KPIs) before it hits your dashboards.

Who Benefits From Custom Connectors?
Agencies relying on client-specific CRMs or lead tracking tools.
Retailers needing integrations with shipping, logistics, or ERP systems.
Startups using new SaaS platforms that don‚Äôt yet have prebuilt connectors.
Enterprises that require custom logic not covered by off-the-shelf tools.

Why Choose Datacharted?
We bring together technical skill and business understanding. Unlike generic connector providers, we:
Write custom, reliable connectors tailored to your needs.
Understand both API engineering and data modeling, ensuring the output is business-ready.
Provide end-to-end support ‚Äî from coding to monitoring.

Get Started
Don‚Äôt let missing connectors hold back your reporting. With Custom API Connectors, you can integrate any platform into your data ecosystem ‚Äî and never lose sight of critical insights.
üì© Contact us today to discuss your data sources and let‚Äôs build connectors that keep your reporting complete.
